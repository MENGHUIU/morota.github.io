Graduate research assistantships in quantitative genetics are 
available with Gota Morota in the Department of Animal Science 
at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).

Current projects in the Morota lab include developing kernel-based 
whole-genome prediction and kernel-based genome-wide association models, 
polygenic modeling of binary traits, reexamining the results from 
quantitative genetics analysis in light of functional annotation, 
and extending kernel methods (such as GBLUP and RKHS) specifically 
tailored for diverse types of emerging omics data.

In addition, candidates will be expected to leverage opportunities to 
interact with faculty in animal genetics and biometrics at the UNL 
in the areas of bioinformatics, breeding, functional genomics, 
quantitative genetics, and molecular genetics.

Candidates should have a B.S. or M.S. degree in quantitative disciplines 
with strong background and interest in statistical computing. 
The starting date can be either Summer 2015 or Fall 2015.

A letter of interest in the position, C.V., and contact information for 
three references should be emailed to Gota Morota at <morota@unl.edu>. 
Review of applications will begin immediately, and continue until the 
positions are filled. Informal inquiries are also welcome.
