This is my negative CV inspired by this [post](http://aidanhorner.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/my-negative-cv.html), this [post](http://chronicle.com/article/MeMy-Shadow-CV/233801), and this [CV](http://www.princeton.edu/haushofer/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf).
As Herbert von Karajan mentioned below, rejections are not always bad things.
